1-the user specifies a URL in their browser.
 the browser initiates a TCP connection to the Web server via its IP address as published in DNS.
 (Web servers by default use TCP port 80 to service incoming requests.).
 As part of this process, the browser also makes DNS lookup requests to convert the URL to an IP address.
2-after the server completes acknowledgment of its side of the TCP connection, the browser sends HTTP requests to the server to retrieve content for the URL.

3-after the server replies with content for the Web page, the browser retrieves the content from the HTTP packets and display it accordingly.
 Content can include embedded URLs for advertising banners or other third-party content,
 that in turn triggers the browser to issue new TCP connection requests to those locations.
 The browser may also save temporary information about its connections to local files on the client computer called cookies.

4-The web server receives the request and checks for the desired page. If the page exists, the web server sends it.
 If the server cannot find the requested page, it will send an HTTP 404 error message.
 (404 means 'Page Not Found' as anyone who has surfed the web probably knows.).
 after the server replies with content for the Web page,the browser retrieves the content from the HTTP packets and display it accordingly.
