Application configuration files contain settings specific to an application.
This file contains configuration settings that the common language runtime reads (such as assembly binding policy,
remoting objects, and so on), and settings that the application can read.

The name and location of the application configuration file depend on the application's host,
The configuration file for an application hosted by the executable host is in the same directory as the application.
 The name of the configuration file is the name of the application with a .config extension.
 For example, an application called myApp.exe can be associated with a configuration file called myApp.exe.config.
The app.config file can be used to provide configuration information in your application.
